        <h1>ALL About Tiffany Laure</h1>

        <h2>Education: </h2> 
         <p> I went to public schooling for my entire life in Montgomery County Maryland. Now I go to a private University here in New York working towards my bachelors degree.

            Here is some of my work experience:
            <ul>
                <li> Data Analyst Protoge </li>
                <li> Systems Programming in Linux Protoge</li>
                <li> Networking Protoge </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
      

        <h3> I also have used various programming languages.</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> HTML - Intermediate</li>
                <li> CSS - Beginner</li>
                <li> Java Script - Amateur</li>
                </ol>
        </p>

        <p> I like to consider myself a jack of all trades. I dance here at St. John's with LIVE Dance Crew. I also sing and play piano, guitar and clarinet. On my free time I like to crotchet but my passion truly lies in acting. I love creating and being free. 
            My favorite song right now is probably "Good, Bad and Ugly" by Giveon. My favorite tv show is probably My Wife and Kids, or Proud Family. Or Booondocks. The list goes on. My favorite movie is Mr and Mrs. Smith.

           </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> Here are some of my favorite websites. </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <a href="https://stjohns.instructure.com"> Pinterest is a website where you can look at inspiration for anything. Life, school, clothes. I like to use it to find inspo for new crotcheting ideas. </a> </li>
               <li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/"> Tik tok is a website or app where you can scroll and watch funny, or relateable videos. Very entertaining. </a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube is a great website too. I watch my favorite people play games, interact with otheres and honestly laugh for 10-20 minutes. </a></li>
